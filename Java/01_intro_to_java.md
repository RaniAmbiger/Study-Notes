# Java Notes

## 📜 1. History
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by **James Gosling** in **1991** at **Sun Microsystems**.  
It was officially released in **1995**. Java was initially designed for embedded systems but quickly became popular for general-purpose software development.

In **2010**, **Oracle Corporation** acquired Sun Microsystems and took over the development of Java.

## 🏗️ 2. Architecture of Java

Java architecture consists of **three main components**:

### 🔧 JDK (Java Development Kit)
- Contains tools required for Java development like:
  - `javac` (compiler)
  - `java` (launcher)
  - `javadoc`, etc.
- Also includes **JRE**.
- Required for both **compilation and execution**.

### 🧱 JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
- Provides runtime environment to run Java applications.
- Includes:
  - **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**
  - Core libraries
- Required **only for execution**, not compilation.

### 🖥️ JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
- Loads `.class` bytecode file.
- Converts bytecode into **machine code**.
- Ensures **platform independence**.

## 🧩 3. Steps to Create and Write Java Program

1. Write the Java program using any editor:
   - Notepad, VS Code, Notepad++, Eclipse, etc.
2. Save the file with `.java` extension.
3. Compile the program using `javac` command.
4. Run the program using `java` command.

## 🧠 4. `javac` – The Java Compiler

The `javac` command is used to **compile Java source code** into **bytecode**.

### ✅ Key Points:

1. **`javac` stands for Java Compiler.**
2. It is included in the **JDK (Java Development Kit)**.
3. It converts `.java` source files into `.class` bytecode files.
4. It checks the **syntax** of the code during compilation.
5. If the program contains **errors**, `javac` will report them with line numbers.
6. The generated bytecode is platform-independent and can run on any JVM.
7. Compilation is a one-time process per change; only modified files need recompilation.

### 🔧 Syntax:
```bash
javac FileName.java
```


## 🌐 5. Why Java is Platform Independent?

- Java compiler (`javac`) generates **bytecode**, not machine code.
- Bytecode can run on **any platform** with a JVM (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.).
- JVM interprets or compiles the bytecode into native machine instructions at runtime.
- This makes Java **write once, run anywhere (WORA)**.

## 📝 6. Naming Convention

- ✅ Class names: `CamelCase`, start with capital letter (e.g., `StudentDetails`)
- ✅ Variable/method names: `camelCase`, start with lowercase (e.g., `studentName`)
- ✅ Constant names: ALL_CAPS (e.g., `MAX_VALUE`)
- ✅ Java file name must match the **public class name** inside the file.

### Example:
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello Java!");
    }
}
```
> File name must be `HelloWorld.java`

---

## 💻 7. Command to Compile and Execute Java Program

### ✅ Compile the program:
```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
```

### ▶️ Run the program:
```bash
java HelloWorld
```

> *Note: Do NOT include `.java` or `.class` while executing.*

## 🧱 8. Structure of a Java Program

### 🧾 Example:
```java
class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
    }
}
```

### 🧷 Structure Breakdown:
- `class Hello`: Defines the class named `Hello`.
- `public static void main(String[] args)`: Main method – entry point of the program.
- `{}`: Curly braces denote the block of code.

## 🖨️ 9. Printing Statements in Java

### 🔹 Print without newline:
```java
System.out.print("Java ");
System.out.print("is ");
System.out.print("fun!");
```

#### Output:
```
Java is fun!
```

---

### 🔸 Print with newline:
```java
System.out.println("Java");
System.out.println("is");
System.out.println("easy");
```

#### Output:
```
Java
is
easy
```

## 🔢 10. Data Types in Java

Java supports **two types** of data types:

### 🔹 1. Primitive Data Types (8 types)

| Data Type | Size     | Default Value | Description                  |
|-----------|----------|---------------|------------------------------|
| byte      | 1 byte   | 0             | Small integer value          |
| short     | 2 bytes  | 0             | Short integer                |
| int       | 4 bytes  | 0             | Integer value                |
| long      | 8 bytes  | 0L            | Long integer value           |
| float     | 4 bytes  | 0.0f          | Decimal value (single-precision) |
| double    | 8 bytes  | 0.0d          | Decimal value (double-precision) |
| char      | 2 bytes  | '\u0000'     | Single character             |
| boolean   | 1 bit    | false         | true or false                |

> Note: `float` and `double` are used for decimal values; `float` requires `f` or `F` suffix.

### 🔹 2. Non-Primitive Data Types
- Also known as **reference types**.
- Examples: `String`, `Arrays`, `Classes`, `Interfaces`, `Objects`.
